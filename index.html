        <figcaption>Cornish game hen with whiskey and cream sauce is the perfect last-minute get-together dinner meal.
         Easy to prepare and half of a hen is the perfect balance between both white and dark meat.  I always have two in my freezer. My go-to when I do not have time to cook a larger chicken.</figcaption>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Cornish hen</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 mediun finely sliced shallots</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup whiskey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>a big pinch of herbs of Provence</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <h3>For the Game Hen</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven at 450º and position the rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
            <li>Place a hen, breast side down on a cutting board. Remove the backbone by cutting along both sides with shears or a large sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Flip the hen and flatten it by pressing down on the breastbone with your palm. Split the hen in two along the breastbone. Repeat with the remaining hen.</li>
            <li>Place on a heavy roasting pan and spread on each half, ¼ of a teaspoon of butter, Herbs de Provence, salt and pepper, and a drop of olive oil. Place in the hot oven and cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Poke the hen while cooking to release any juices.</li>
            <li>When done, remove from the oven, place the hen in a dish and cover with aluminum foil and let rest.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the Whiskey and Cream Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the unwashed cooking pan over the stove and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and let it melt. Lower the heat and add the whiskey, very slowly. With a wooden spoon scrape up any bit on the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the shallots and cook until tender, 1 minute. Add the Worcestershire sauce, mustard and raise the heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil stirring constantly</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream and the lemon juice. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve hot over the Cornish hen.</li>
        </ol>
